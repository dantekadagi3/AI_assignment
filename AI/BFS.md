Explanation:

The Graph class is created to represent an undirected graph using an adjacency list.
The addVertex method adds a vertex to the graph.
The addEdge method adds an undirected edge between two vertices.
The bfs method performs a Breadth-First Search starting from the given vertex.
It uses a queue to keep track of vertices to visit.
It uses an array result to store the order of visited vertices.
It uses an object visited to keep track of visited vertices.
The while loop continues until the queue is empty, visiting each vertex's neighbors and adding unvisited neighbors to the queue.

javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjacencyList = {};
    }

class Graph: This defines a class named Graph. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods.
constructor(): This is a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created.
this.adjacencyList = {}: Inside the constructor, we're initializing an empty object called adjacencyList. This will hold all the vertices (nodes) of the graph and their connections (edges).

##Adding Vertices
javascript
Copy code
    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
            this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];
        }
    }
addVertex(vertex): This method adds a vertex to the graph.
if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]): It checks if the vertex already exists in the adjacency list.
this.adjacencyList[vertex] = []: If the vertex doesn't exist, it creates an empty array for that vertex in the adjacency list. This array will hold all the vertices connected to this vertex.

##Adding Edges
javascript
Copy code
    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push(vertex2);
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push(vertex1);
    }
addEdge(vertex1, vertex2): This method adds an edge (a connection) between two vertices.
this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push(vertex2): It adds vertex2 to the list of connections for vertex1.
this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push(vertex1): It adds vertex1 to the list of connections for vertex2. This makes the graph undirected (i.e., the connection goes both ways).


##Breadth-First Search (BFS)
javascript
Copy code
    bfs(start) {
        const queue = [start];
        const result = [];
        const visited = {};
        visited[start] = true;
bfs(start): This method performs a breadth-first search starting from the given vertex.
const queue = [start]: It initializes a queue with the starting vertex. A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
const result = []: It initializes an array to store the order of visited vertices.
const visited = {}: It initializes an object to keep track of visited vertices.
visited[start] = true: It marks the starting vertex as visited.


javascript
Copy code
        while (queue.length) {
            const currentVertex = queue.shift();
            result.push(currentVertex);
while (queue.length): The loop runs as long as there are vertices in the queue.
const currentVertex = queue.shift(): It removes the first vertex from the queue and stores it in currentVertex.
result.push(currentVertex): It adds the current vertex to the result array.


this.adjacencyList[currentVertex].forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }
this.adjacencyList[currentVertex].forEach(neighbor => { ... }): It loops through all the neighbors (connected vertices) of the current vertex.
if (!visited[neighbor]): It checks if the neighbor has been visited.
visited[neighbor] = true: If the neighbor hasn't been visited, it marks it as visited.
queue.push(neighbor): It adds the neighbor to the queue for future exploration.
javascript
Copy code
        return result;
    }
}
return result: After the loop finishes, it returns the result array, which contains the order of visited vertices.
